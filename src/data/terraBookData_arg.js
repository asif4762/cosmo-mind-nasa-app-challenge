            "Mateo lived near the Chaco forest. One morning the wind felt hotter and dustier. No birds sang. “Too many trees have fallen,” Grandma whispered. “The land is changing.”"

          story:
            "Mateo remembered tall quebracho and algarrobo trees. Now many were gone, cut for ranches and soy. Bare ground cracked in the sun. “Where will the animals go?” he asked."

          story:
            "Rains came wrong: months too dry, then sudden floods that drowned fields and homes. “Seasons aren’t like when I was a boy,” Father sighed. Mateo wondered if Earth was angry."

            "Buenos Aires was loud and busy. Tall buildings hid the sky. Mateo searched for trees but saw only a few, dusty and tired between streets. He missed the green Chaco."

          story:
            "Summer heat felt trapped by walls and roads. “Why is the city hotter?” Mateo asked. “Too much cement and cars, not enough trees,” Uncle said. Mateo thought of home."
