          caption: "A silent dawn at the forest edge",
          story:
            "Lucas woke up in a small village on the edge of the Amazon. Usually the morning sang with macaws and toucans. Today, it was quiet. The mahogany and Brazil nut trees looked tired—leaves thin, branches drooping. His grandmother touched a trunk and whispered, “Too many trees have fallen, filho.” The air felt heavy and hot, even before sunrise."

          caption: "Clearings where giants once stood",
          story:
            "Lucas remembered running under giant trees while monkeys chattered above. Now, wide patches were gone—burned ground and cattle ranches spread where forest had been. The soil was dry, rivers were lower, animals had vanished. “Where will the jaguars and parrots go?” he asked. The forest answered with silence."

          caption: "Too little, then too much",
          story:
            "Rain came unpredictably. Some months, rivers shrank and the land cracked. Other times, sudden storms flooded homes and fields. “The rains no longer follow the old ways,” his mother said. Lucas watched water rise and thought about the food that would be lost."

          story:
            "By noon, the heat felt like a furnace. The few trees left gave little relief. Lucas fanned himself while his sister hid in a thin patch of shade. “The Earth is burning,” Grandfather muttered. Lucas looked up, wishing for the clouds that once cooled the forest."

          story:
            "One morning, Father said, “Our crops can’t grow anymore. We must go to Manaus.” Lucas turned for a final look at the trees and river. The forest smelled different—hotter, quieter. Would he ever hear the macaws again?"

          story:
            "Manaus was crowded. Boats, buses, and cars filled the air with noise. Streets and buildings stretched in every direction. Lucas looked for trees but found only a few, dusty and tired, trapped between walls and asphalt. He missed the deep green and wild songs of the Amazon."

          story:
            "Heat pressed down from every surface—roads, walls, even the air. “Why is it hotter here?” Lucas asked. “Too much concrete, too many streets, not enough trees,” his uncle said. “This is urban heat.” Lucas wiped his forehead and dreamed of the forest’s cool shadows."

          story:
            "On the rooftop, Lucas saw a neighbor planting herbs, flowers, and a small guava tree in pots. “Plants bring life and coolness,” she said. Lucas felt a spark: even here, the city could grow a little greener."

          story:
            "With his uncle’s help, Lucas planted a young mahogany near their home. Each morning he watered it. Each evening he whispered, “Grow strong. Give shade. Bring back the birds.” The small tree became his companion—and his hope."

          story:
            "At sunset, the little tree’s leaves swayed in warm wind. Lucas closed his eyes and heard the rainforest in his mind—the river’s flow, parrots calling, jaguars padding softly. He placed his hand on the trunk and promised: “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, the whispers of the rainforest will return.”"
