          caption: "Sherwood edge at dawn, strangely silent",
          story:
            "Ella woke early near Sherwood Forest. Birds were quiet. The oak outside looked tired—thin branches, browning leaves. Granddad touched the bark. “Too many trees have been cut,” he said. The air felt warm and heavy, even before sunrise."

          caption: "Stumps where oaks and beeches once stood",
          story:
            "Ella remembered hide-and-seek among ferns while robins and jays called overhead. Now many trees were gone. Machines left stumps and broken earth. “Where will the birds go?” she asked. The deep silence answered."

          caption: "Too dry… then sudden floods",
          story:
            "The weather changed. Some months brought almost no rain; fields cracked. Other months, storms flooded rivers and streets, washing away paths and crops. “The seasons aren’t like they used to be,” Mum said. Ella hoped the land would feel normal again."

          caption: "Hot midday under thin oak shade",
          story:
            "By midday, the air felt heavy and hot. Even oak shade gave little relief. Her brother fanned himself with a notebook. “The Earth is warming faster than we can imagine,” Granddad muttered. Ella wished for cooling clouds."

          caption: "Leaving fields and river for London",
          story:
            "“The farm can’t provide enough,” Dad said. “We must move to London.” Ella’s heart ached as she looked back at woods, fields, and the river of her childhood. Would she hear robins again?"

          story:
            "London was loud and crowded. Buses rumbled, cars honked, towers blocked the sky. Trees were small and scarce, tucked between walls and streets. Ella missed Sherwood’s soft green."

          caption: "Urban heat islands explained",
          story:
            "The city felt hotter than the village. Concrete and buildings trapped warmth. “Why is it so hot?” Ella asked. “Urban heat,” Uncle said. “Too much concrete, too few trees.” Ella longed for forest shade."

          story:
            "On their rooftop, a neighbour planted herbs, flowers, and a small apple tree. “Plants bring life,” she smiled. Ella felt hope. Maybe green could survive here too."

          story:
            "With Uncle’s help, Ella planted a rowan near their building. Each day she watered it. Each evening she whispered, “Grow strong. Bring shade. Bring the birds back.” The tiny tree became her symbol of hope."

          story:
            "At sunset, Ella stood by the rowan. Its small leaves swayed in the breeze. She imagined Sherwood—the rustle of leaves, birds calling, soft wind through trees. Hand on the stem, she promised: “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, the UK’s forests will whisper again.”"
