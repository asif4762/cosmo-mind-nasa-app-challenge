          caption: "Southern Chile at dawn, a forest gone quiet",
          story:
            "Sofía lived near the forest in southern Chile. One morning the woodpeckers and parrots were silent. The great araucaria outside dropped its needles. “Too many trees are gone,” Grandfather said. The air felt dry and too warm."

          story:
            "Sofía remembered tall lenga and coigüe trees and clear rivers. Now large parts were cut for timber and farms. Only stumps remained. “Where will pumas and birds go?” she asked. No one answered."

          story:
            "Sometimes the sky stayed empty for months and the soil cracked. Other times heavy rain came suddenly, flooding roads and rivers. “The weather has changed,” Mother sighed. Sofía watched the rushing water and worried about the future."

          story:
            "By midday, heat pressed down. Crops near her home were weak. Even the remaining trees didn’t feel cool. “The Earth is thirsty,” Grandfather said. Sofía wished for clouds, but the sky was empty."

          story:
            "“We can’t grow enough food,” Father said. “We must move to Santiago.” Sofía looked at the forest and snowy Andes one last time. Would she hear parrots again?"

          story:
            "Santiago was vast and crowded. Cars and buses roared and smog hid the mountains. Buildings blocked the sky. Sofía searched for trees and found only a few, dusty and tired. She missed the forest’s green whisper."

          caption: "Urban heat: too much cement, too few trees",
          story:
            "Summer heat felt endless. Pavement burned; walls trapped hot air. “Why is the city hotter?” Sofía asked. “Too much cement and too many cars—and not enough trees,” her uncle said. “That’s urban heat.”"

          story:
            "On the rooftop, a neighbor planted tomatoes, herbs, and a small lemon tree in pots. “Plants cool our homes and bring life,” she smiled. Sofía felt a little hope return."

          story:
            "With her uncle, Sofía planted a small araucaria near their home. Each day she carried water. Each night she whispered, “Grow tall. Bring back the birds. Remind me of the forest.”"

          story:
            "At sunset behind the Andes, the young tree swayed in the breeze. Sofía imagined rustling branches and parrots calling. She placed her hand on the trunk and promised: “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, Chile’s forests will whisper again.”"
