          caption: "A spring dawn that feels too warm",
          story:
            "Liam woke early near the boreal forests of British Columbia. The usual bird songs and pine whispers were missing. A tall spruce looked fragile, with bare spots. “They’ve cut too many trees,” Grandfather said softly. The air felt too warm for spring."

          caption: "Where giants once stood",
          story:
            "Liam used to run under spruce, pine, and fir. Now, clear-cuts and stumps stretched across hills. “Where will the animals go?” he asked. Grandfather had no answer. The forest replied with silence."

          caption: "Late snows, sudden floods, and wildfires",
          story:
            "Snow came late and melted fast. Spring rains were heavier, flooding streams and lakes. Some summers, wildfires turned forests to ash. “The seasons aren’t the same,” Mother said. Liam wondered if the forests could heal."
        },

          year: "Page 4 — The Summer Heat",
          image: "/images/can_page4_summer_heat.jpg",
          caption: "When shade can’t cool the day",
          story:
            "By July, the sun felt harsh. Even in the shade, birds and small animals struggled. “The Earth is changing faster than we can,” Grandfather said. Liam stared at the hills, hoping for a breeze."

          caption: "A last look at lakes and pines",
          story:
            "“Our crops aren’t enough,” Father said. “We must move near Toronto for work.” Liam’s chest felt heavy. Would he hear the wind in the pines again?"
        },

          caption: "Tall buildings, tiny parks",
          story:
            "Toronto was crowded and loud. Streetcars rumbled, cars honked, towers blocked the sky. Trees were scarce, trapped in tiny parks. Liam missed the smell of pine and the calm of the lakes."

          year: "Page 7 — Urban Heat",
          image: "/images/can_page7_urban_heat.jpg",
          caption: "Why cities feel hotter",
          story:
            "Pavements and walls gave off heat. “Why is it hotter here?” Liam asked. “Concrete traps the sun, and there aren’t enough trees,” his uncle said. “It’s called urban heat.”"
        },

          story:
            "On the rooftop, a neighbor grew flowers, herbs, and a tiny maple in a planter. “Plants bring life,” she said. “Even a small garden helps.” Liam felt a spark of hope."

          story:
            "With his uncle, Liam planted a small spruce on the rooftop. Each morning he watered it. Each evening he whispered, “Grow tall. Bring shade. Remind me of home.”"

          caption: "Guardians of the forest",
          story:
            "At sunset, the spruce swayed by the skyline. Liam imagined rustling pines, cool lakes, and birdsong. He placed his hand on the trunk and promised: “I will protect you. I will plant more. One day, Canada’s forests will whisper again.”"
