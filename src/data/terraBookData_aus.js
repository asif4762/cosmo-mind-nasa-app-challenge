          story:
            "Liam woke before sunrise near the eucalypt forests of New South Wales. No kookaburra laughter today. The trees looked weak—pale leaves, brittle branches. Grandfather whispered, “Too many were cut. The forest is suffering.” Even the breeze felt warm and heavy."

          story:
            "Liam remembered tall trees and busy birds. Now, patches were gone. Logging and fires left bare, scarred ground. “Where will the animals go?” he asked. No one answered. The silence felt louder than any reply."

          caption: "Droughts, then sudden floods",
          story:
            "Rain no longer came on time. Some months, rivers ran dry and soil cracked. Other times, storms hit fast and hard, flooding homes and fields. “Too little… or too much,” Mother sighed. Liam worried for the forest and the farm."

          story:
            "By noon, the air felt like a furnace. Thin eucalypt shade gave little relief; hot wind carried dust. Liam fanned himself while his sister wiped sweat. “The Earth is burning,” Grandfather said. Liam wished for clouds that never came."

          story:
            "“The farm is failing. We must move to Sydney,” Father said. Liam looked at the forest, the fields, the river he loved. As they left, he wondered if he would ever hear the kookaburras again."

          caption: "Sydney streets, little shade",
          story:
            "Sydney was loud and crowded. Tall buildings hid the sky. Trees were few and tired, squeezed between roads and walls. Liam missed the forest smell, the cool shade, the open land."

          caption: "Urban heat island",
          story:
            "Pavements burned; walls trapped heat. “Why hotter than home?” Liam asked. “Concrete, cars, and few trees,” Uncle said. “That’s urban heat.” The city felt like an oven."

          story:
            "On the rooftop, a neighbor planted flowers, herbs, and a small lemon-scented gum. “Even small plants bring life,” she smiled. “They cool the air and bring hope.” Liam felt a spark inside."

          story:
            "With Uncle’s help, Liam planted a young eucalyptus near their building. Each morning, he watered it. Each evening, he whispered, “Grow strong. Bring shade. Bring the birds back.” The tiny tree became his friend."

          story:
            "At sunset, the small tree swayed in warm wind. Liam closed his eyes and heard the forest again—kookaburras, leaf whispers, soft eucalypt breath. Hand on the trunk, he promised, “I’ll protect you. I’ll plant more. One day, the forests will whisper again.”"
